The Product Sector Transition Risk Indicator measures the transition risk of
products based on the sector's emissions targets the product belongs to. Those
sector emission reduction targets vary across scenarios (e.g., net zero
scenario or 1.5Â° scenario) and the time horizon (e.g., reduction needed in
2030, 2040, 2050 to achieve the targets).

After assessing each product, all the products with the same category are
aggregated and set in relation to all products of the company. We, therefore,
derive company-level information.

The goal of the transition risk MVP is to create a first draft of how the
transition risk indicator would be build in code in order to convert it into
code production easily in the future.
