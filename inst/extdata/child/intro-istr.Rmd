The Input Product Sector Risk Indicator assesses the transition risk of the input products based on the sector's emissions targets the input product belongs to. This indicator can be aggregated on company level and as such inform about the supply chain risk of an SME, based on its inputs’ transition risk. The sector emission reduction targets vary across scenarios (e.g., net zero scenario or 1.5° scenario) and the time horizon (e.g., reduction needed in 2030, 2040, 2050 to achieve the targets). It, therefore, is similar to the Product Sector Risk Indicator but focuses on the input products that the company needs to produce its products.The input products are, for example, resources, packaging materials, energy and enabling services (such as tractor use on farm) to produce the product.

After identifying each carbon footprint for one input product, the input
products are ranked according to their footprint. The ranking method is explained in the 
[Thresholds](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/tiltIndicator/articles/tiltIndicator.html#thresholds) section.

After assessing the input products for each product, they are aggregated at
company-level to derive what percentage of the input products required by the
company to produce its products have high, medium and low sector transition
risk. We, therefore, derive the company-level information.

Please note that carbon emissions or emissions always mean CO2e.
