The Input Product Carbon Transition Risk Indicator assesses the transition risk
of the input products due to their relative carbon footprint to other input
products. As a default option, each input product will be compared to the carbon
footprint of every other input product. Alternatively, users can also choose to
compare those input products of the same type, so e.g., comparing only raw
materials with each other. Input products with a higher carbon footprint will
also face a higher risk.

The Input Product Carbon Transition Risk Indicator is therefore similar to the
Product Carbon Transition Risk Indicator, but it focuses on the input products
and not the product of the company. Input products are, for example, resources,
packaging materials, energy and enabling services (such as tractor use on farm)
to produce the product.

After identifying each carbon footprint for one input product, the input
products will be ranked according to their footprint. Input products in the
highest percentile (≥70%) will be classified as high transition risk input
products. Input products in the medium percentile (between ≥30% and <70%) will
be classified as medium transition risk input products. Products in the lowest
percentile (<30%) will be classified as low transition risk input products.

After assessing the input products transition risk based on its carbon footprint
for each product, they will be aggregated at company-level. We derive what
percentage of the input products are high, medium and low transition risk.

The goal of the transition risk MVP is to create a first draft of how the
transition risk indicator for inputs would be build in code in order to convert
it into code production easily in the future.

The transition risk indicator consists of 2 broad steps:

1. Score input products: Identifying the input products for each product, and
calculating the relative carbon footprint per input product.
2. Score companies: Aggregating on the company-level.


Sample data set includes inputs and co2 footprints for each product from
Ecoinvent and sectors from Europages. NOTE: the following columns are a complete
random selection and do not reflect the true information:

- co2 footprints (not allowed to share licensed data right now)
- sectors (as the matching with ecoinvent is not done yet, we do not have one sector per product yet)
