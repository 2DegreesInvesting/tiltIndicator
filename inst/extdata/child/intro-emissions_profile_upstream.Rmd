The indicator "emissions profile upstream" assesses the transition risk of the
upstream products due to their relative carbon footprint to other upstream
products. As a default option, each upstream product is compared to the carbon
footprint of every other upstream product. Upstream products with a higher
carbon footprint face a higher risk. On a company-level, the indicator proxies
for the supply chain risk of a company - based on its inputs.

The indicator "emissions profile upstream" is therefore similar to the Product
Carbon Transition Risk Indicator, but it focuses on the upstream products and
not the product of the company. Upstream products are, for example, resources,
packaging materials, energy and enabling services (such as tractor use on farm)
to produce the product.

After identifying each carbon footprint for one upstream product, the input
products are ranked according to their footprint. The ranking method is
explained in the
[Thresholds](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/tiltIndicator/articles/tiltIndicator.html#thresholds)
section.

After assessing the upstream products' transition risk based on the carbon
footprint of each product, they are aggregated at the company-level. We derive
what percentage of the upstream products are high, medium and low transition
risk.

This indicator consists of 2 broad steps:

1. Score upstream products: Identifying the upstream products for each product,
and calculating the relative carbon footprint per upstream product.
2. Score companies: Aggregating on the company-level.

The sample data set includes inputs and co2 footprints for each product from
Ecoinvent and sectors from Europages. NOTE: the following columns are a
completely random selection and do not reflect the true information:

- co2 footprints (not allowed to share licensed data right now)
- sectors (as the matching with ecoinvent is not done yet, we do not have one sector per product yet)
