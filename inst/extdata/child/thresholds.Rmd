Products in the highest percentile (greater than `high_threshold`) are classified 
as high transition risk products. Products in the medium percentile (greater 
than `low_threshold` and lower or equal than `high_threshold`) are classified as 
medium transition risk products. Products in the lowest percentile (lower or 
equal than `low_threshold`) are classified as low transition risk products. 
For details about the default `low_threshold` and `high_threshold`, refer to the documentation of 
the corresponding `*_profile_*()` function (e.g. [`sector_profile()`](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/tiltIndicator/reference/sector_profile.html#ref-usage)).
