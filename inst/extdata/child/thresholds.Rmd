Products in the highest percentile (greater than `high_threshold`) are classified 
as high transition risk products. Products in the medium percentile (greater 
than `low_threshold` and lower or equal than `high_threshold`) are classified as 
medium transition risk products. Products in the lowest percentile (lower or 
equal than `low_threshold`) are classified as low transition risk products. 
For details about the default `low/high_thresholds`, refer to the documentation of 
the corresponding `**tr()` function ([example](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/tiltIndicator/reference/xctr.html#ref-usage)).
